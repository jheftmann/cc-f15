									<li>Create (write, draw, photograph, etc.) materials for a collage.</li>
									<li>Use the coding techniques weâ€™ve learned so far to create your collage.</li>
									<li>Make your collage interactive. Will a user interact with it? Can they alter it? Contribute to it? Will it change over time?</li>
									<li>Document various states of the collage. What could you do with these? Are some more visually interesting than others?</li>

                  Here is the one we made in class: <a href="http://b.parsons.edu/~heftmanj/week-10/">http://b.parsons.edu/~heftmanj/week-10/</a>. This example would require more work before I turned it in. Also, try to use things other than <code>draggable</code> and circles.
