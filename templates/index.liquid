								<h2>Course description</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="section-content">

								<p>This course will introduce students to the building blocks of creative computing within the visual and media environment. Students will learn to create dynamic images, type and interfaces, that can translate into print, web and spatial forms. Through weekly problems, students will learn programming fundamentals that translate in virtually all programming platforms.</p>

								<h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
								<p>By the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
								<ol>
								<li>Demonstrate knowledge of fundamental programming concepts</li>
								<li>Develop several visual & interactive projects</li>
								<li>Objectively present their design process and workflow</li>
								<li>Integrate a variety of media elements into their projects</li>
								<li>Problem solve with other students through reading other students’ code</li>
								<li>Demonstrate the ability to research and learn unfamiliar technical topics</li>
								</ol>
								<br>
								<h5>Class Website</h5>
								<p>The class website can be found at http://jheftmann.github.io/cc-f15/ and will be updated with assignments, resources, and information. If you’re not sure of something, the class website is usually a good place to start.</p>

								<h5>Equipment and Materials</h5>
								<p>All students are expected to bring a laptop and charger with them to class. In addition, there will be some (free) software and services required for the class. There is a list on the class website.</p>

								<h5>Readings</h5>
								<p>There is no specific textbook for the course, but I will occasionally assign readings that will be discussed in the following class. Readings will be posted to the class website.</p>

								<h5>Attendance and Participation</h5>
								<p>Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time.</p>
								Attendance is considered part of your participation grade. Per New School policy, three or more absences or repeatedly being late to class will result in a failing grade. If you need to miss class, please email me in advance and make arrangements to turn your assignments in on time.</p>

								<h5>Assignments</h5>
								<p>Weekly assignments will be posted to the class website. They are due before the next class meets, unless otherwise noted. The final assignment will be a culmination of the topics covered in the weekly assignment and will be due at the final class of the semester. There will also be in-class critiques, guest speakers, and reading discussions which count toward your participation grade.

								<h2>Grading</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="section-content">
								<h5>Grades will be given along the following scale:</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>A—Exceptional</li>
									<li>B—Good</li>
									<li>C—Average</li>
									<li>D—Below average</li>
									<li>F—Poor</li>
								</ul>

								<br>

								<h5>Grades will be calculated as follows:</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>25%–Participation, attitude, and attendance</li>
									<li>50%–Weekly projects</li>
									<li>25%–Final project</li>
								</ul>

								<br>

								<h5>Projects are graded based on the following criteria:</h5>
								<ol>
									<li>Satisfies the requirements of the assignment</li>
									<li>Execution exhibits care and pride in craftsmanship</li>
									<li>Code is not only functional but also organized</li>
									<li>Designs communicate concepts clearly, usably, and in visually interesting ways</li>
									<li>Concept and content are not secondary to presentation</li>
									<li>Are turned in on-time</li>
								</ol>

								<br>

								<h5>Responsibility</h5>
								<p>Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent.

								<p>Late assignments will be accepted but only for a maximum grade of C+.</p>

								<h2>Policies</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="section-content">
								<h5>Electronic Devices</h5>
								<p>There are no rules against using phones or laptops during class. They are necessary tools and learning to manage distractions is an important studio skill. However, if you are not paying attention it’s easy to tell and it will be reflected in your participation grade.</p>

								<h5>Academic Honesty and Integrity</h5>
								<p>The New School views “academic honesty and integrity” as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for
								that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this “accurate use”. The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog.</p>
								<p>It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.</p>

								<h5>Student Disability Services (SDS)</h5>
								<p>In keeping with the University’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to meet with Jason Luchs in the Office of Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to you to bring to me. SDS assists students with disabilities in need of academic and programmatic accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability/.">(Link)</a></p>
